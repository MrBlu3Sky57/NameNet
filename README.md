## Plan
In this project I will build up the mathematical formulations of a deep feedforward network
(See the writeups folder) then use this theory to build a character level language model for name generation.ß

## Acknowledgments

The ideas in **NameNet** are based on foundational research and inspiring implementations, including:

- [Bengio et al. (2003)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) — *A Neural Probabilistic Language Model* provided the conceptual backbone for building a statistical language model using neural networks.
- [Andrej Karpathy's `char-rnn`](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) — This repo inspired the character-level generation format and workflow.
- [Cybenko (1989)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0893608089900208) — *Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function* laid the theoretical groundwork for universal function approximation with neural networks.

While all code and mathematical derivations were developed independently, these resources deeply informed the design and motivation of the project.
